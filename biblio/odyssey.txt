The game is set in 431â€“422 BC, four hundred years before the events of Assassin's Creed Origins. It recounts a secret mythological history set during the Peloponnesian War, which was fought between the city-states of Greece. The player takes on the role of a mercenary and is able to fight for the Delian League, led by Athens, or the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta.
 The game's main storyline has the player character attempting to restore their fractured family after they and their siblings were thrown off a cliff in their youth and left for dead by their father by the command of the Spartan oracle. Parallel quest lines deal with the extirpation of a malign cult spanning the Greek world, and the discovery of artifacts and monsters from Atlantean times.

As with previous games in the series, Odyssey features a narrative set in the modern-day and follows Layla Hassan, who was introduced in Assassin's Creed Origins.
